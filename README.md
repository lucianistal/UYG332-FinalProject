**Course:** UYG332 Image Processing  
**Instructor:** Batuhan Hangun

## Project Overview

This individual project demonstrates the application of fundamental image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV. The dataset includes six images, and each task showcases a different operation, such as intensity analysis, image transformations, noise filtering, unsharp masking, and enhancement.

## Contents

- `uyg332_final_project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all solutions.
- Image dataset provided by the instructor (do not modify or replace images).
- This `README.md` file.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the zip.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
3. Run each cell in order to reproduce the results and visualizations.

## Notes

- All images are used strictly from the dataset provided.
- Each problem includes both Markdown explanations and image outputs.
- The code follows the academic integrity rules as outlined in the project guidelines.
